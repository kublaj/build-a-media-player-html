## Build a Media Player with HTML

Hi!

If you've stumbled upon this, you've most likely found my SitePoint post. Yipee!

Ok, so let's get started and build a media player with HTML. This is only the start of this example and you can develop it further with CSS and JavaScript. I can show you how, but that's all part of my course <a href="learnable.com/courses/getting-started-with-html-media-2904">Getting Started with HTML Media</a> on <a href="learnable.com">Learnable</a>. 

If you liked this lesson then I would highly recommend going to Learnable and checking it out.

Happy Learning!
